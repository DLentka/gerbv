Indentation
-----------
To hack in this code you need to set emacs (or whatever you use) to
4 indentation steps and {} at the right places (see code).
Not negotiable.

My ~/.emacs are:
(defun my-c-mode-hook ()
  (turn-on-font-lock)
  (setq c-basic-offset 4))

(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)


Curly Braces
------------

if () {
    blah1();
    blah2();
} else {
    yada1();
    yada2();
}
If there is only one statement you don't need the braces.

for() {
    do_whatever();
}

switch() {
case foo:
    blah1();
    break;
case bar:
    blah2();
    break;
default:
    break;
Switch should always have a default case.



ChangeLog
---------
Minor changes (cosmetic, minor (up to 4,5 lines) not reported bugs) 
doesn't need a ChangeLog entry. A ChangeLog entry is needed when a 
reported bug is fixed (with bug report number) or when a feature is 
added. I (spe) use ChangeLog when writing release notes.
