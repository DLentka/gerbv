2001-11-23 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerb_image.h, src/draw.c, src/gerber.c, src/scm_gerber.c:
	  Are now able to parse and display polyogon area fill codes.

	
2001-11-21 Andreas Andersson (e92_aan@e.kth.se)

	* src/drill.c:
	  The format guessing code now guesses right for
	  one more format.
	  More M codes recognized (and later ignored).

	
2001-11-20 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/scm_gerber.c: Backend didn't receive the last
	  entry in the netlist due to bad loop constraint.
	* src/gerber.c: Made sure angles always are positive when
	  calculating multi quadrant ones.
	* src/gerber.c: Improved error detection by checking that
	  all part of an image is there.
	* src/gerber.c: Fix for EagleCad caused other Gerber files
	  to fail. Only D-code 1-3 on a line should also be considered
	  as a change.
	
	
2001-11-15 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerbv.c: Tooltips over radio buttons with name
	  of loaded file.

	
-- Release 0.0.5 --	

	
2001-11-14 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerbv.c: Changed speed key for zooming in to
	  Alt-O.
	* configure.in: Changed version number for release.
	
	
2001-11-09 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerb_image.[hc]: Added.
	* src/drill.[hc], src/gerber.[hc], src/scm_gerber.[hc]:
	  Changed to utilize the new "class", gerb_image.

	
2001-11-07 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/draw.c, src/gerber.c: Implemented multi quadrant arcs.
	  Calculated with a separate function; should be able to be
	  combined with single quadrant calculations. Not properly 
	  tested since I need better examples.
	
	
2001-11-06 Andreas Andersson (e92_aan@e.kth.se)

	* src/drill.h, src/drill.c:
	  parse_drillfile() now ignores unstandard text in headers.
	  Also, it now returns the actual unit used (it used to return
	  the unit of the input file).
	  Minor fixes, mostly moved stuff around.

2001-11-03 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/drill.c, src/scm_gerber.c: Fixed bug causing backend
	  first not to generate aperture list and then barfing when
	  trying.

	
2001-11-03 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerbv.c: Added command line -d|--drill support 
	  for drill files both in graphical mode and batch mode.
	  Though are drill file tool/apertures not properly handled
	  by ->scheme converter.
	* man/gerbv.1: Changed man page to reflect the new switches.
	
2001-11-03 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerber.[hc]: Cleaned up code after latest hack.
	* src/scm_gerber.c: Changed format of list delivered to
	  the backend; no delta center points. Now it's all calculated
	  center points and angles.
	* scheme/gerb-ps.scm: Accept the new list, but doesn't do anything
	  with it yet.

	
2001-11-03 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerber.c: Inserted check for undefined apertures that
	  was earlier removed.

	
2001-11-02 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerber.h, src/gerber.c, src/draw.c: Now almost
	  all calculation for circles is done when parsing and
	  not when (re)drawing.
	* src/gerbv.c: Removed two unnecessary defines.
	
	
2001-10-31 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerbv.c: Added zooming with scroll wheel on mouse.
	* README: Added info on how to configure XFree86 for scroll mouse.

	
2001-10-28 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerber.[hc]: Fixed bug causing parser to reports
	  points with wrong aperture. Pointed out by Dan Christian.
	

2001-10-30 Andreas Andersson (e92_aan@e.kth.se)

	* src/drill.c, src/gerber.h, src/gerber.c
	  Moved new_image() to the correct place

	
2001-10-28 Andreas Andersson (e92_aan@e.kth.se)

	* src/Makefile.am
	  Added drill.c to SOURCES since it seems to work well enough
	  for some testing.
	* src/drill.c
	  Added an input file format guessing function.
	  Some kludges to get around scaling problems.
	* src/gerbv.c
	  Separated File/Open command into File/Open Gerber... and
	  File/Open Drill... Added functions to open drill files.
	* src/*.c:
	  A few speling errors fixed.

	
2001-10-28 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/draw.c, src/gerber.h, src/gerber.c, src/scm_gerber.c:
	  aperture array is now full size and array index is very
	  simple.
	

2001-10-27 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/*.[ch]: typedef:ed all internal structs to *_t
	

-- Release 0.0.4 --	
	
2001-10-27 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerber.[hc]: EagleCad generates broken Gerber.
	  I kindly detect and then tries to run as nothing 
	  happened. Disable kludge with commenting out 
	  EAGLECAD_KLUDGE in src/gerber.h.
	  This was pointed out to me by Dan Christian and
	  later confirmed by Fredrik Jonsson sent me some
	  examples. Thanks guys!
	* AUTHORS/CONTRIBUTORS: Added latest bunch of contributing
	  people.
	* configure.in: Updated version to 0.0.4 before release.
	
	
2001-10-24 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/draw.[hc]: Added. Extracted drawing functions from
	  gerbv.c.
	* src/gerbv.c: Removed add drawing functions into draw.c.
	  Also minor clean ups. Fixed #def's of Guile support.
	* src/Makefile.am: Added draw.c as src file.
	
	
2001-10-22 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* example/*: Cleaned out numpres.pcb.* to a separate dir
	  and added a example received from Joachim Jansen on
	  separate aperture files.

	
2001-10-21 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* gerbv.c: Changed how cw and ccw is handled when drawing
	  arcs to avoid swapping of start and stop points.
	* gerbv.c: Red dots at "aperture macros wanna-be's" scale
	  with ordinary scale, so they don't disappear when scaling
	  around.

	
2001-10-09 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* gerber.h, gerber.c: Added 'D' as possible Format
	  Statement after patches from Uwe Bonnes
	  <bon@elektron.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de>. Thanks!
	* scm_gerber.c: Broke out omit_zeros_t to scm type
	  conversion and added 'explicit to this type.

	
2001-09-03 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* configure.in: fixed bug when testing for opt_backend_dir
	  causing configure to fail at least on Solaris.
	* INSTALL: updated with info now that automake's in use.

	
2001-09-02 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* build-release, rebuild-conf: missing files when running
	  automake are now copied instead of linked. Thanks
	  Dan <mcmahill@mtl.mit.edu> for reporting this.

	
2001-08-31 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* Splitted AUTHORS to AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS
	* src/gerb-ps.scm: removed 
	* build_release uses anonymous cvs from sourceforge
	  to build the release.
	* src/scm_gerber.c, src/gerbv.c:
	  Now the scheme backend receives the name of the parsed file
	* scheme/gerb-ps.scm: Utilizes the above feature by creating output
	  filename by prepending input filename with ".ps"
