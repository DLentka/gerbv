	* build-release, rebuild-conf: missing files when running
	  automake are now copied instead of linked. Thanks
	  Dan <mcmahill@mtl.mit.edu> for reporting this.

	* Splitted AUTHORS to AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS
	* src/gerb-ps.scm: removed 
	* build_release uses anonymous cvs from sourceforge
	  to build the release.
	* src/scm_gerber.c, src/gerbv.c:
	  Now the scheme backend receives the name of the parsed file
	* scheme/gerb-ps.scm: Utilizes the above feature by creating output
	  filename by prepending input filename with ".ps"
