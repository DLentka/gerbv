	* src/gerbv.c: Added command line -d|--drill support 
	  for drill files both in graphical mode and batch mode.
	  Though are drill file tool/apertures not properly handled
	  by ->scheme converter.

	* src/gerber.[hc]: Cleaned up code after latest hack.
	* src/scm_gerber.c: Changed format of list delivered to

	  with it yet.

	  was earlier removed.

	
2001-11-02 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/gerber.h, src/gerber.c, src/draw.c: Now almost
	  all calculation for circles is done when parsing and
	  not when (re)drawing.
	* src/gerbv.c: Removed two unnecessary defines.

2001-10-28 Andreas Andersson (e92_aan@e.kth.se)

	* src/Makefile.am
	  Added drill.c to SOURCES since it seems to work well enough
	  for some testing.
	* src/drill.c
	  Added an input file format guessing function.
	  Some kludges to get around scaling problems.
	* src/gerbv.c
	  Separated File/Open command into File/Open Gerber... and
	  File/Open Drill... Added functions to open drill files.
	* src/*.c:
	  A few speling errors fixed.

	
2001-10-28 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* src/draw.c, src/gerber.h, src/gerber.c, src/scm_gerber.c:
	  aperture array is now full size and array index is very
	  simple.

	* src/gerber.[hc]: EagleCad generates broken Gerber.
	  I kindly detect and then tries to run as nothing 
	  happened. Disable kludge with commenting out 
	  EAGLECAD_KLUDGE in src/gerber.h.
	  This was pointed out to me by Dan Christian and
	  later confirmed by Fredrik Jonsson sent me some
	  examples. Thanks guys!
	* AUTHORS/CONTRIBUTORS: Added latest bunch of contributing
	  people.
	* configure.in: Updated version to 0.0.4 before release.

	  gerbv.c.
	* src/gerbv.c: Removed add drawing functions into draw.c.
	  Also minor clean ups. Fixed #def's of Guile support.

	* example/*: Cleaned out numpres.pcb.* to a separate dir
	  and added a example received from Joachim Jansen on
	  separate aperture files.

	
2001-10-21 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* gerbv.c: Changed how cw and ccw is handled when drawing
	  arcs to avoid swapping of start and stop points.
	* gerbv.c: Red dots at "aperture macros wanna-be's" scale
	  with ordinary scale, so they don't disappear when scaling
	  around.

	
2001-10-09 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* gerber.h, gerber.c: Added 'D' as possible Format
	  Statement after patches from Uwe Bonnes
	  <bon@elektron.ikp.physik.tu-darmstadt.de>. Thanks!
	* scm_gerber.c: Broke out omit_zeros_t to scm type
	  conversion and added 'explicit to this type.

	* configure.in: fixed bug when testing for opt_backend_dir
	  causing configure to fail at least on Solaris.
	* INSTALL: updated with info now that automake's in use.

	
2001-09-02 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* build-release, rebuild-conf: missing files when running
	  automake are now copied instead of linked. Thanks
	  Dan <mcmahill@mtl.mit.edu> for reporting this.

	
2001-08-31 Stefan Petersen (spe@stacken.kth.se)

	* Splitted AUTHORS to AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS
	* src/gerb-ps.scm: removed 
	* build_release uses anonymous cvs from sourceforge
	  to build the release.
	* src/scm_gerber.c, src/gerbv.c:
	  Now the scheme backend receives the name of the parsed file
	* scheme/gerb-ps.scm: Utilizes the above feature by creating output
	  filename by prepending input filename with ".ps"
