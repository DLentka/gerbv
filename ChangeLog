	* gerbv.c: Changed how cw and ccw is handled when drawing
	  arcs to avoid swapping of start and stop points.
	* gerbv.c: Red dots at "aperture macros wanna-be's" scale

	  around.

	* Splitted AUTHORS to AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTORS
	* src/gerb-ps.scm: removed 
	* build_release uses anonymous cvs from sourceforge
	  to build the release.
	* src/scm_gerber.c, src/gerbv.c:
	  Now the scheme backend receives the name of the parsed file
	* scheme/gerb-ps.scm: Utilizes the above feature by creating output
	  filename by prepending input filename with ".ps"
