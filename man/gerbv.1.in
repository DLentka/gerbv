.SH USAGE
When you start gerbv you can give the files to be loaded on the command line,
either as each file separated with a space or by using wildcards.

The user interface is graphical. Simply press left mouse button and the image
will pan as you move the mouse. To manipulate a layer, right-click on
one of the rightmost buttons. That will bring up a pop-up menu where
you can select what you want to do with that layer (load file, change
color, etc).

If you hold the mouse button over one the rightmost button a tooltips will
show you the name of the file loaded on that layer.

Currently only 20 layers are supported. Changing this number needs a 
one line change (MAX_FILES in gerbv.c) in the source and a recompilation.

Zooming can be handled by either menu choices, keypressing, middle mouse 
button or scroll wheel. If you press Alt+I you will zoom in and if you
press Alt+O you will zoom out.If you press middle mouse button you will zoom
out, and if you press Shift and middle mouse button you will zoom in. 
Scroll wheel works if you enabled that in your X server and mapped it
to button 4 and 5.

You can also do zooming by outline. Press left mouse button, draw,
release.  The dashed line shows how the zooming will be dependent on
the resolution of the window. The non-dashed outline will show what
you actually selected.

You can do measurement on the image displayed. By pressing shift, the 
cursor changes to a plus. By using left mouse button you can draw the lines
that you want to measure. Currently the gerber files must be in inches. 
The result of the last measurement is also displayed on the statusbar.
All measurements are in the drawing until you either zoom, pan or press the
escape key.

The statusbar shows the current mouse position on the layer in the same 
coordinates as in the file. Ie if you have (0,0) in the middle of the image
in the gerber files, the statusbar will show (0,0) at the same place.
