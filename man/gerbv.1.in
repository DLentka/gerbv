.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIgerbv\fP is a viewer for Gerber files. Gerber files is generated
from different PCB CAD programs and are sent to subcontractors to
actually make the PCB. \fIgerbv\fP also supports Excellon/NC drill files.

\fIgerbv\fP is GTK+ based and contains a possibility to run in "batch mode".
When running in batch mode, gerbv parses the Gerber file and calls an
external Scheme function with the parsed data. The Scheme implementation
is based on Guile.

.SH USAGE
The user interface is graphical. To manipulate a layer, right-click on
one of the rightmost buttons. That will bring up a pop-up menu where
you can select what you want to do with that layer (open file, change
color, etc).

Currently only 20 layers are supported. Changing this number needs a 
one line change (MAX_FILES in gerbv.c) in the source and a recompilation.

Zooming can be handled by either menu choices, keypressing, middle mouse 
button or scroll wheel. If you press Alt+I you will zoom in and if you
press Alt+O you will zoom out.If you press middle mouse button you will zoom
out, and if you press Shift and middle mouse button you will zoom in. 
Scroll wheel works if you enabled that in your X server and mapped it
to button 4 and 5.
