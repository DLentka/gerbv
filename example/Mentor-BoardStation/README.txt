This file is sent by David Cussans at University of Bristol High Energy 
Physics Group. It contains example on an excessive use of corners 
in polygons, which broke my hardcoded polygon-corner array. It also uses 
millimeters or rather a mixture of millimeters and inches, which still
is unsupported.

This is also serves as an example file from Mentor Boardstation.
