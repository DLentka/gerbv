Sample files from J. Wilson submitted to the gEDA user mailing list

Example of compilcated macros with comments and calculations in them.

gerbv segfaulted on this.

"the macro renders two rectangles overlapped to form a larger rectangle 
with four small squares removed from its corners.  The squares are then 
filled by four circles centered so the result is a rectangle with its 
pointy bits rounded off."

The example is made to two files; one with comments but no calculations
and one with comments and calculations.
