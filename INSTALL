Installation instructions 


The build system of gerbv is based on GNU Autoconf.

Simple build instructions would (currently) be:
% ./configure
% make
% make install

To recreate the configuration files you have to run:
% aclocal
% autoheader
% autoconf
% automake --copy --add-missing


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to build gschem you must install the following packages first:
* GLIB 1.2.x
* GTK+ 1.2.x
* Guile 1.4


If you don't have Guile installed and have no intention of running
gerbv in batch mode you can simply omit Guile (and therefore batch 
mode) at configure time:

	./configure --disable-batch


If your make program is called gmake (for instance on Sun platforms) you
can run this by typing:
% MAKE=gmake ./configure
% gmake
% gmake install
