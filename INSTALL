Install instructions for gerbv

GNU Electronic Design Automation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation instructions 


The build system of gerbv is based on GNU Autoconf. The build system
is not complete as of this writing. Basically you can say that 'make
install' is not implemented yet.

Simple build instructions would (currently) be:
% ./configure
% make

The executable is situated in the src directory and is called gerbv.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to build gschem you must install the following packages first:
* GLIB 1.2.x
* GTK+ 1.2.x
* Guile 1.4


If you don't have Guile installed and have no intention of running
gerbv in batch mode you can simply omit Guile (and therefore batch 
mode) at configure time:

	./configure --disable-batch
