Installation instructions 


The build system of gerbv is based on GNU Autoconf.

Simple build instructions would (currently) be:
% ./configure
% make
% make install

To recreate the configuration files you have to run:
% aclocal
% autoheader
% autoconf
% automake --copy --add-missing


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to build gerbv you must install the following packages first:
* GLIB 1.2.x
* GTK+ 1.2.x
* Guile 1.4 is optional
* GdkPixbuf can be configured out
* libpng can be configured out


If you're interested in running gerbv in batch mode you have to install
Guile and run at configure time:

  ./configure --enable-batch

If you don't want to have the possibility to export Gerber images to PNG
(and thus removing dependency on GdkPixbuf and libpng) you can run:

  ./configure --disable-exportpng

The following switches are also available at configure time:
--with-maxfiles=<number> where <number> is how many files you want to have
  open at the same time. Default is 20.
--enable-unit-mm if you want to default measurement units to millimeters.
  Default is mil.

If your make program is called gmake (for instance on Sun platforms) you
can run this by typing:
% MAKE=gmake ./configure
% gmake
% gmake install
