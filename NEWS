New in 0.0.4

- Support for broken Gerbers generated by EagleCad.

- Minor reorganisation of source (split out drawing code).

- Some minor changes on how to calculate single quadrants.


New in 0.0.3

- Now Automake _copies_ files when building distribution.

- Minor bugfix in configure.in so now Solaris should work too.


New in 0.0.2

- Automake in use, so now the build system is "complete"
  - make install, make uninstall etc works
  - gerbv --batch=<backend> now searches local directory, 
    $HOME/.gerbv/scheme and ${prefix}/share/gerbv/scheme until it finds
    a valid backend, ie gerb-<backend>.scm.
  - backends moved from src to scheme in tarball

- Version flag changed from -v to -V

- Fixed 64-bit build problems thanks to patches from Dan <mcmahill@mtl.mit.edu>
  He also fixed some other build problems.
