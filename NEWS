For a complete list of changes, refer to ChangeLog.

- libgerbv:  fixed a bug in the min/max calculation.
- libgerbv:  improved the ability to parse drill files with
             user specified formats.
- libgerbv:  Compile with -no-undefined to make it easier to build
             windows DLL's.
- configure: Improve detection of tools when cross-compiling.
- libgerbv:  Improved example programs.
- gerbv:     Changed desktop categories to be more consistent with
             the rest of gEDA.

             for proper win32 operation and helps in some cases
             on other operating systems.  As part of this, improve
             how init.scm is located at startup.
- gerbv:     Improved the project file load/save dialog.
