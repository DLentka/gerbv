Since almost all documents I have found on the Internet has copyright
forbidding the distribution of them, I have instead made a list of
information about RS-274[XD]. I found them basically using google.

Gerber is designed by Gerber Systems, which has been bought by
Barco. Ie Barco (http://www.barco.com/graphics/) has the best
descriptions.

* What's all this about RS274X Anyway?

"If you're a PCB designer you're probably hearing more and more about 
extended Gerber - RS274X. The latest versions of many PCB layout programs 
either offer RS274X as an option or only output RS274X-- such as Cadence's 
Allegro."

Discusses the extension to RS27X from RS274D. Continuation from above.

* A Free Gerber to TIF converter in C++
Adam Seyschell has made a program called gerb2tif. Available at:
     http://home.alphalink.com.au/~seychell/


* A Free Gerber to EPS converter
Dirk Baechle (dl9obn@darc.de) has released a small C++ program to convert 
Gerber to Encapsulated PostScript. Platform independent commandline program.
According to the README in version 1.0 "At the moment only a small subset 
of the RS-274D standard is implemented". Note that it is D! You have to hack
in every aperture, depsite giving it an X file.
