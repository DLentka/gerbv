Since almost all documents I have found on the Internet has copyright
forbidding the distribution of them, I have instead made a list of
information about RS-274[XD]. I found them basically using google.

Gerber is designed by Gerber Systems, which has been bought by
Barco. Ie Barco (http://www.barco.com/graphics/) has the best
descriptions.

* What's all this about RS274X Anyway?

"If you're a PCB designer you're probably hearing more and more about 
extended Gerber - RS274X. The latest versions of many PCB layout programs 
either offer RS274X as an option or only output RS274X-- such as Cadence's 
Allegro."

Discusses the extension to RS27X from RS274D. Continuation from above.
