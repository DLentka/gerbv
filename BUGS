Currently KNOWN BUGS

All OS:

Reporting about macro parameters (obtained via "analyze" -> "analyze visible
Gerber layers", and found in the "Aperture definitions" tab) incorrectly
reports the macro parameters found.

-------------------------------

Win32:

Due to a bug in cairo, the library used for graphical rendering,
directing printing to a printer will cause artifacts around diagonal
traces and circular pads.  Until cairo, a 3rd party library, is fixed
the workaround if you need to print is to export to PDF and use the free
adobe reader software to open and print the PDF file.

Cairo version 1.6.4 is known to have this bug.  It is possible that later
versions have fixed it.

Win32:

On certain platforms, rendering of the Gerber image(s) is very slow.
It is believed that this has to do with GTK's handling of draws and
updates under Windows.
